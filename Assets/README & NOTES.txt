Running

===============================================
1. Run the program both on your phone and on your computer.
2. Insert the local IP address of your computer (which should be displayed) to your phone.
3. Click the "Connect" button on your phone.
4. Run sm64 on your computer.
5. You should be able to control Mario using your phone, if not, try out the solutions of the problem you have below.
===============================================
Problems

===============================================
1. It doesn't do anything.
Three possible solutions:
- Reinstall the prerequisites.
- Reset sm64 controls to default, which should be easy enough.
- Connect your phone to the same network that the computer is connected to.


2. It's laggy.
Solution:
Change the mode using the button on the top right corner on your phone:
TCP/IP mode will be reliable but sometimes slow,
UDP mode will be faster, but information will sometimes not arrive on your computer.

If that does not help, consider connecting your computer using a wired connection to the same network that the phone is connected to.

3. It makes my device hot.
Solution:

Buy a better heatsink for your computer, or place a fan nearby. It should cool down the devices.
